# Targeting System

Targeting System is designed for mouse + keyboard. Targets are selected based on mouse position. The system prioritizes the moused-over target, then the closest target to the cursor. Having the mouse available opens up gameplay opportunities lost in traditional lock-on systems such as ground-targeted attacks, instant target switching, and easier access to UI elements.

## Project Features
